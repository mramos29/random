# Random Scripts and Configurations

Some random scripts, configurations or quick hacks I've created to solve specific issues and that were spread across a lot of servers... Keeping this stuff, might need it again in the future.

- nginx-redirect.conf: redirects a server name based on a regex to a final server name
- nginx-proxy_pass-regex.conf: proxy_pass based on a regex
- post-block.sh: quick hack to block ips with more than a certain number of POST requests
- backup-to-s3.sh: backups a compressed file to a AWS S3 bucket using s3cmd. Keeps backups during x days.
